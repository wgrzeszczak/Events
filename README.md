# Events
Simple, C#-like event system

## Usage
1. Create a new event handler
```
struct KeyPressEventArgs : public Events::EventArgs {
	int key;
	int state;

	KeyPressEventArgs(int key, int state) {
		this->key = key;
		this->state = state;
	}
}

Event<KeyPressEventArgs> keyPressEvent;
```
2. Add a callback:
```
keyPressEvent.bind([](const KeyPressEventArgs& args) {
	std::cout << "Key: " <<  args.key << " State: " << args.state;
});
```
or use the overloaded += operator.
```
keyPressEvent += [](const KeyPressEventArgs& args) {
	std::cout << "Key: " <<  args.key << " State: " << args.state;
};
```
3. Fire the event handler:
```
keyPressEvent.fire({ 65, 1 });
```
4. Remove a callback
```
Events::EventToken token = keyPressEvent.bind([](const KeyPressEventArgs& args) {
	std::cout << "Key: " <<  args.key << " State: " << args.state;
});
keyPressEvent.unbind(token);
```
or use the overloaded -= operator.
```
keyPressEvent -= token;
```
